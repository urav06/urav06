**Commit:** [urav06/leetcode-journal](https://github.com/urav06/leetcode-journal) by [@urav06](https://github.com/urav06) · [`5318cc5`](https://github.com/urav06/leetcode-journal/commit/5318cc5d5ad0bbc20d50ec7d8683c38f5cfbf6a6)

**Message:** "Leetcode 75 | Array/String | Medium"

---

**Review:** Solid work logging another few LeetCode problems, including a clean O(N) pass for increasing triplets. However, problem #151 (Reverse Words) mysteriously decided its URL should point to 'reverse vowels of a string' — an admirable display of either deep irony or a classic copy-paste misadventure. Hopefully, `increasingTriplet2` makes more sense than its truncation lets on.
