**Commit:** [torvalds/linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) by [@Unknown](https://github.com/Unknown) · [`1da177e`](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2)

**Message:** "Linux-2.6.12-rc2

Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
infrastructure for it.

Let it rip!"

**Review:** This is the Genesis commit for Git on Linux, where Linus, ever the pragmatist, deliberately cut history to bootstrap the new VCS without bloat. Adding Rusty's extensive locking guide from the jump highlights the sheer complexity Git was about to tame. A true founding moment, chaotic in its magnitude but brilliant in its pragmatism.
