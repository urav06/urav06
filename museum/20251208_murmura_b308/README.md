**Commit:** [Cloudslab/murmura](https://github.com/Cloudslab/murmura) by [@murtazahr](https://github.com/murtazahr) · [`b3080ad`](https://github.com/Cloudslab/murmura/commit/b3080ad999bae6014b518e58b2776f16b163072b)

**Message:** "Update gitignore file."

---

**Review:** An 'update gitignore' commit that instead *completely* deletes a colossal `CLAUDE.md`? This is the kind of revision control wizardry I've seen before. Clearly, the project decided the AI assistant's instructions were either utterly useless, entirely too prescriptive, or perhaps just... *ignorable*. Or maybe it truly *was* causing issues that an `.gitignore` update would typically resolve, just with more… theatricality.
