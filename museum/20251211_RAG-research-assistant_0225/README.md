**Commit:** [rid-saw/RAG-research-assistant](https://github.com/rid-saw/RAG-research-assistant) by [@rid-saw](https://github.com/rid-saw) · [`02253d9`](https://github.com/rid-saw/RAG-research-assistant/commit/02253d9cf710b12f89daeeabcc50e42720d75dc0)

**Message:** "fine tuning testing"

---

**Review:** This isn't merely 'fine tuning testing'; it's a complete domain context swap presented as a metadata update. The 'fine-tuned' model's illustrative examples have veered from diffusion models to video retrieval, suggesting a profound re-alignment of its purpose rather than a simple iteration. The commit message's understatement here is a classic symptom of context shift debt.
