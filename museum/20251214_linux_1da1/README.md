**Commit:** [torvalds/linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) by [@Unknown](https://github.com/Unknown) · [`1da177e`](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2)

**Message:** "Linux-2.6.12-rc2

Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
infrastructure for it.

Let it rip!"

**Review:** Starting a new repository with a deliberate history reset is a classic Linus move: ruthlessly pragmatic, prioritizing immediate utility over historical preservation. It's profoundly fitting that among the colossal initial import for the Linux kernel, the presented diff happens to be Rusty Russell's 'Unreliable Guide To Locking'—because who needs historical context when your future is being built on reliable concurrency primitives?
