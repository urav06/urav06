**Commit:** [7wik-pk/racing-line-mapper](https://github.com/7wik-pk/racing-line-mapper) by [@7wik-pk](https://github.com/7wik-pk) · [`89dfa06`](https://github.com/7wik-pk/racing-line-mapper/commit/89dfa06803774031d7704932c3e409f3b4e65620)

**Message:** "minor changes"

---

**Review:** Calling these 'minor changes' is either peak self-deprecation or masterful misdirection. Replacing hardcoded magic numbers with proper constants for reward functions is a vital improvement for clarity and tuneability, and those `switch` statements are just good hygiene. A solid win for maintainability.
