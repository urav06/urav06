**Commit:** [7wik-pk/safetrek](https://github.com/7wik-pk/safetrek) by [@7wik-pk](https://github.com/7wik-pk) · [`b56db2e`](https://github.com/7wik-pk/safetrek/commit/b56db2edd9df951fcd1903ea4c3146cc75323349)

**Message:** "Revise project description in README

Updated project description for clarity."

---

**Review:** The project's academic origins are now undeniably clear, a fine detail for future maintainers and evaluators. And lo, the `No newline at end of file` curse on the README has finally been vanquished. Small victories, eh?
