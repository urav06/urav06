**Commit:** [torvalds/linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) by [@Unknown](https://github.com/Unknown) · [`1da177e`](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2)

**Message:** "Linux-2.6.12-rc2

Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
infrastructure for it.

Let it rip!"

**Review:** The Big Bang, pragmatic edition. Eschewing the immense historical baggage for a clean Git slate—a shrewd move when building infrastructure from scratch—this commit birthed the Linux kernel's Git repo. The simultaneous inclusion of Rusty's 'Unreliable Guide To Locking' speaks volumes about the inherent, inescapable concurrency nightmare everyone signed up for.
