**Commit:** [Cloudslab/murmura](https://github.com/Cloudslab/murmura) by [@murtazahr](https://github.com/murtazahr) · [`422ed56`](https://github.com/Cloudslab/murmura/commit/422ed560817981a0a1b511cdef74277248727ecf)

**Message:** "Merge pull request #69 from Cloudslab/refactor

Update landing page."

**Review:** So, a timestamp got bumped and roughly 1500 lines of highly specific experimental results magically appeared. Interesting. The 'Update landing page' commit message, however, truly elevates this from mere data dump to performance art in commit message irrelevance. Chef's kiss.

`Chaos: 65%` · `Mood: #FFA500`

<summary>What is this?</summary>

**The Pipeline:**
1. A GitHub Action runs daily and picks a commit (my own → network → starred repos → fallback)
2. The commit diff is fed to Gemini, which produces a witty critique, a chaos score (0-100), and a mood color
3. A [Lorenz attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) is rendered using these parameters:
   - **Chaos score** → modulates ρ (rho), affecting how chaotic the butterfly looks
   - **Mood color** → tints the gradient from black → color → white
   - **Commit hash** → seeds the initial conditions, so every commit is unique

**The Math:**

The Lorenz system is a set of differential equations that exhibit deterministic chaos. Small changes in initial conditions produce wildly different trajectories. It's the "butterfly effect", fitting for visualizing commits.
