**Commit:** [urav06/dialectic](https://github.com/urav06/dialectic) by [@urav06](https://github.com/urav06) · [`6305bfc`](https://github.com/urav06/dialectic/commit/6305bfcf63202a0ae72f6f1b60dde2935744bcd6)

**Message:** "New Debate Added: markov-blanket-brain-environment"

**Review:** Adding an entire philosophical debate, replete with weighted arguments, meticulous academic sourcing, and profound ontological critiques, all neatly tucked into a JSON file? This isn't just version control; it's version control for consciousness. The rigor is admirable, if somewhat absurd for plain data. Someone built an intellectual Everest in JSON.

`Chaos: 65%` · `Mood: #4B0082`

<summary>What is this?</summary>

**The Pipeline:**
1. A GitHub Action runs daily and picks a commit (my own → network → starred repos → fallback)
2. The commit diff is fed to Gemini, which produces a witty critique, a chaos score (0-100), and a mood color
3. A [Lorenz attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) is rendered using these parameters:
   - **Chaos score** → modulates ρ (rho), affecting how chaotic the butterfly looks
   - **Mood color** → tints the gradient from black → color → white
   - **Commit hash** → seeds the initial conditions, so every commit is unique

**The Math:**

The Lorenz system is a set of differential equations that exhibit deterministic chaos. Small changes in initial conditions produce wildly different trajectories. It's the "butterfly effect", fitting for visualizing commits.
