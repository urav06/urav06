#### 📌 Featured Commit

This section auto-updates daily. It features one of my recent commits, or something interesting from my network, or a random gem from the wild. The commit gets roasted by an opinionated AI and rendered as a strange attractor.

**Commit:** [urav06/leetcode-journal](https://github.com/urav06/leetcode-journal) by [@urav06](https://github.com/urav06) · [`289ceab`](https://github.com/urav06/leetcode-journal/commit/289ceabad1e8431c134296224ab6e17ebea5fed8)

**Message:** "Initial commit"

**Review:** An 'initial commit' for a LeetCode journal, proudly declaring an MIT license for 2025. It's either impressively optimistic foresight for future endeavors, or a sign the repository exists on a different temporal plane. Regardless, establishing a license early is proper hygiene.

<summary>What is this?</summary>

**The Pipeline:**
1. A GitHub Action runs daily and picks a commit (my own → network → starred repos → fallback)
2. The commit diff is fed to Gemini, which produces a witty critique, a chaos score (0-100), and a mood color
3. A [Lorenz attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) is rendered using these parameters:
   - **Chaos score** → modulates ρ (rho), affecting how chaotic the butterfly looks
   - **Mood color** → tints the gradient from black → color → white
   - **Commit hash** → seeds the initial conditions, so every commit is unique

**The Math:**

The Lorenz system is a set of differential equations that exhibit deterministic chaos. Small changes in initial conditions produce wildly different trajectories. It's the "butterfly effect", fitting for visualizing commits.
