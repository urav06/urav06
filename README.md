**Commit:** [urav06/leetcode-journal](https://github.com/urav06/leetcode-journal) by [@urav06](https://github.com/urav06) · [`5318cc5`](https://github.com/urav06/leetcode-journal/commit/5318cc5d5ad0bbc20d50ec7d8683c38f5cfbf6a6)

**Message:** "Leetcode 75 | Array/String | Medium"

**Review:** Solid work logging another few LeetCode problems, including a clean O(N) pass for increasing triplets. However, problem #151 (Reverse Words) mysteriously decided its URL should point to 'reverse vowels of a string' — an admirable display of either deep irony or a classic copy-paste misadventure. Hopefully, `increasingTriplet2` makes more sense than its truncation lets on.

`Chaos: 40%` · `Mood: #A0E7A0`

**The Pipeline:**
1. A GitHub Action runs daily and picks a commit (my own → network → starred repos → fallback)
2. The commit diff is fed to Gemini, which produces a witty critique, a chaos score (0-100), and a mood color
3. A [Lorenz attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) is rendered using these parameters:
   - **Chaos score** → modulates ρ (rho), affecting how chaotic the butterfly looks
   - **Mood color** → tints the gradient from black → color → white
   - **Commit hash** → seeds the initial conditions, so every commit is unique

**The Math:**

The Lorenz system is a set of differential equations that exhibit deterministic chaos. Small changes in initial conditions produce wildly different trajectories. It's the "butterfly effect", fitting for visualizing commits.
