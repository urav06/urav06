#### 📌 Featured Commit

This section auto-updates daily. It features one of my recent commits, or something interesting from my network, or a random gem from the wild. The commit gets roasted by an opinionated AI and rendered as a strange attractor.

**Commit:** [rid-saw/RAG-research-assistant](https://github.com/rid-saw/RAG-research-assistant) by [@rid-saw](https://github.com/rid-saw) · [`02253d9`](https://github.com/rid-saw/RAG-research-assistant/commit/02253d9cf710b12f89daeeabcc50e42720d75dc0)

**Message:** "fine tuning testing"

---

**Review:** This isn't merely 'fine tuning testing'; it's a complete domain context swap presented as a metadata update. The 'fine-tuned' model's illustrative examples have veered from diffusion models to video retrieval, suggesting a profound re-alignment of its purpose rather than a simple iteration. The commit message's understatement here is a classic symptom of context shift debt.

<summary>What is this?</summary>

**The Pipeline:**
1. A GitHub Action runs daily and picks a commit (my own → network → starred repos → fallback)
2. The commit diff is fed to Gemini, which produces a witty critique, a chaos score (0-100), and a mood color
3. A [Lorenz attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) is rendered using these parameters:
   - **Chaos score** → modulates ρ (rho), affecting how chaotic the butterfly looks
   - **Mood color** → tints the gradient from black → color → white
   - **Commit hash** → seeds the initial conditions, so every commit is unique

**The Math:**

The Lorenz system is a set of differential equations that exhibit deterministic chaos. Small changes in initial conditions produce wildly different trajectories. It's the "butterfly effect", fitting for visualizing commits.
