**Commit:** [urav06/leetcode-journal](https://github.com/urav06/leetcode-journal) by [@urav06](https://github.com/urav06) · [`10bfccc`](https://github.com/urav06/leetcode-journal/commit/10bfccce1dfc2e960f8364771112e0b9c55b3495)

**Message:** "Leetcode 75 | Array/String | Easy"

**Review:** Another day, another pair of problem statements committed to the void. It's clean, well-formatted, and exactly what one would expect from a diligent LeetCode journalkeeper. Perfectly unremarkable, in the best possible way.

`Chaos: 15%` · `Mood: #90EE90`

**The Pipeline:**
1. A GitHub Action runs daily and picks a commit (my own → network → starred repos → fallback)
2. The commit diff is fed to Gemini, which produces a witty critique, a chaos score (0-100), and a mood color
3. A [Lorenz attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) is rendered using these parameters:
   - **Chaos score** → modulates ρ (rho), affecting how chaotic the butterfly looks
   - **Mood color** → tints the gradient from black → color → white
   - **Commit hash** → seeds the initial conditions, so every commit is unique

**The Math:**

The Lorenz system is a set of differential equations that exhibit deterministic chaos. Small changes in initial conditions produce wildly different trajectories. It's the "butterfly effect", fitting for visualizing commits.
