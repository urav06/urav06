#### 📌 Featured Commit

This section auto-updates daily. It features one of my recent commits, or something interesting from my network, or a random gem from the wild. The commit gets roasted by an opinionated AI and rendered as a strange attractor.

**Commit:** [7wik-pk/safetrek](https://github.com/7wik-pk/safetrek) by [@7wik-pk](https://github.com/7wik-pk) · [`b56db2e`](https://github.com/7wik-pk/safetrek/commit/b56db2edd9df951fcd1903ea4c3146cc75323349)

**Message:** "Revise project description in README

Updated project description for clarity."

**Review:** A revision so minor it barely ripples the commit log, yet every clarification of provenance helps the lost soul navigating open source. Adding that missing newline at EOF, though – truly an artisan's touch. Stability achieved, one character at a time.

<summary>What is this?</summary>

**The Pipeline:**
1. A GitHub Action runs daily and picks a commit (my own → network → starred repos → fallback)
2. The commit diff is fed to Gemini, which produces a witty critique, a chaos score (0-100), and a mood color
3. A [Lorenz attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) is rendered using these parameters:
   - **Chaos score** → modulates ρ (rho), affecting how chaotic the butterfly looks
   - **Mood color** → tints the gradient from black → color → white
   - **Commit hash** → seeds the initial conditions, so every commit is unique

**The Math:**

The Lorenz system is a set of differential equations that exhibit deterministic chaos. Small changes in initial conditions produce wildly different trajectories. It's the "butterfly effect", fitting for visualizing commits.
