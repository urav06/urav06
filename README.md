#### 📌 Featured Commit

This section auto-updates daily. It features one of my recent commits, or something interesting from my network, or a random gem from the wild. The commit gets roasted by an opinionated AI and rendered as a strange attractor.

**Commit:** [srbhr/Resume-Matcher](https://github.com/srbhr/Resume-Matcher) by [@srbhr](https://github.com/srbhr) · [`8780069`](https://github.com/srbhr/Resume-Matcher/commit/87800695c672adcb6d99ca80b2285c0a8f18747a)

**Message:** "Merge pull request #558 from srbhr/dependabot/pip/apps/backend/urllib3-2.6.0"

**Review:** Dependabot delivering another `urllib3` update is less innovation and more like scheduled preventative maintenance. It's utterly boring, but essential work that saves future headaches—a quiet testament to proper dev practices, assuming the tests are actually robust enough to catch breaking changes.

**The Pipeline:**
1. A GitHub Action runs daily and picks a commit (my own → network → starred repos → fallback)
2. The commit diff is fed to Gemini, which produces a witty critique, a chaos score (0-100), and a mood color
3. A [Lorenz attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) is rendered using these parameters:
   - **Chaos score** → modulates ρ (rho), affecting how chaotic the butterfly looks
   - **Mood color** → tints the gradient from black → color → white
   - **Commit hash** → seeds the initial conditions, so every commit is unique

**The Math:**

The Lorenz system is a set of differential equations that exhibit deterministic chaos. Small changes in initial conditions produce wildly different trajectories. It's the "butterfly effect", fitting for visualizing commits.
