**Commit:** [Cloudslab/murmura](https://github.com/Cloudslab/murmura) by [@murtazahr](https://github.com/murtazahr) · [`4ac99b8`](https://github.com/Cloudslab/murmura/commit/4ac99b8d5e979c0d8164f3901778f1db847ee63f)

**Message:** "Update murmura framework."

**Review:** Ah, an 'update' that involves completely excising one dataset and stapling in a brand new one. 'Out with the old, in with the new,' they say, when what they mean is, 'This other one suits our immediate purpose better.' Decisive, if a tad aggressive for a mere 'update.'

`Chaos: 65%` · `Mood: #3498db`

<summary>What is this?</summary>

**The Pipeline:**
1. A GitHub Action runs daily and picks a commit (my own → network → starred repos → fallback)
2. The commit diff is fed to Gemini, which produces a witty critique, a chaos score (0-100), and a mood color
3. A [Lorenz attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) is rendered using these parameters:
   - **Chaos score** → modulates ρ (rho), affecting how chaotic the butterfly looks
   - **Mood color** → tints the gradient from black → color → white
   - **Commit hash** → seeds the initial conditions, so every commit is unique

**The Math:**

The Lorenz system is a set of differential equations that exhibit deterministic chaos. Small changes in initial conditions produce wildly different trajectories. It's the "butterfly effect", fitting for visualizing commits.
